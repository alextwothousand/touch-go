# touch-go
touch command written in Golang

## Why?
I felt like a Golang solution would be nicer. Plus, this can create multiple files, not just one. Touch till your heart's content!

## Install
Windows (Scoop):
```
scoop bucket add devlexanderxyz https://github.com/devlexanderxyz/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install touch
```
Other:
Download from `releases` tab.
